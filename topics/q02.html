    <h1>COMP20008 - Classification Problems: Exam Practice</h1>

    <h2>Question 2</h2>
    <p><strong>Which of the following is the best example of a classification problem?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Predicting whether a customer will purchase an item at an online retailer based on their browsing history.</li>
        <li>Predicting which sports team will win an upcoming match.</li>
        <li>Predicting the likelihood that an Instagram user will like a given photo.</li>
        <li>Predicting how much a customer will spend at an online retailer in the next year based on their past purchase history.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Predicting whether a customer will purchase an item at an online retailer based on their browsing history.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a classification problem because it involves predicting a categorical outcome (i.e., "purchase" or "not purchase"). Classification problems are characterized by predicting discrete labels or categories, such as whether something is true or false.
    </div>

    <h2>Practice Question 1</h2>
    <p><strong>Which of the following is an example of a classification problem?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Predicting the price of a stock at the end of the day.</li>
        <li>Predicting whether a given email is spam or not spam.</li>
        <li>Predicting the temperature in a city tomorrow.</li>
        <li>Predicting the number of units sold of a product next month.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Predicting whether a given email is spam or not spam.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a classification problem because it involves predicting a label (i.e., "spam" or "not spam"). Classification problems focus on assigning inputs to predefined categories.
    </div>

    <h2>Practice Question 2</h2>
    <p><strong>Which of the following tasks would be best suited for classification analysis?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Determining the probability of rain tomorrow.</li>
        <li>Predicting if a given bank transaction is fraudulent or not.</li>
        <li>Predicting the height of a person based on age and gender.</li>
        <li>Predicting the annual revenue of a company.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Predicting if a given bank transaction is fraudulent or not.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a classification problem because it involves assigning the label "fraudulent" or "not fraudulent" to each transaction. The goal is to classify transactions into one of these two categories.
    </div>

    <h2>Practice Question 3</h2>
    <p><strong>Which of the following is not an example of a classification problem?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Predicting whether a person has diabetes based on their health data.</li>
        <li>Classifying emails into different folders based on their content.</li>
        <li>Predicting the price of a house based on its features.</li>
        <li>Determining whether a customer will renew their subscription or not.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Predicting the price of a house based on its features.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Predicting the price of a house is a regression problem, as it involves estimating a continuous numerical value. Classification problems, on the other hand, involve assigning categories or labels.
    </div>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Classification problems involve predicting a label or category for an input, such as whether an email is spam or not, or whether a customer will purchase a product. These problems differ from regression problems, which predict continuous numerical values. Understanding the nature of the output helps determine whether a classification or regression model is appropriate for a given problem.</p>
