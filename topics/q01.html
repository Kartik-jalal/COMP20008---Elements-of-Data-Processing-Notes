    <h1>COMP20008 - Regression and Classification: Exam Practice</h1>

    <h2>Question 1</h2>
    <p><strong>Which of the following is the best example of a regression problem?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Predicting how much a customer will spend at an online retailer in the next year based on their past purchase history.</li>
        <li>Predicting which sports team will win an upcoming match.</li>
        <li>Predicting whether a customer will purchase an item at an online retailer based on their browsing history.</li>
        <li>Predicting the likelihood that an Instagram user will like a given photo.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Predicting how much a customer will spend at an online retailer in the next year based on their past purchase history.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a regression problem because it involves predicting a continuous numerical value (i.e., the amount of money). Regression problems focus on predicting quantities, whereas classification problems involve predicting categories or labels.
    </div>

    <h2>Practice Question 1</h2>
    <p><strong>Which of the following is an example of a classification problem?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Predicting the price of a stock at the end of the day.</li>
        <li>Predicting whether an email is spam or not spam based on its content.</li>
        <li>Predicting the temperature in a city tomorrow.</li>
        <li>Predicting the height of a tree given its age.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Predicting whether an email is spam or not spam based on its content.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a classification problem because it involves predicting a label (i.e., "spam" or "not spam"). Classification problems focus on assigning inputs to one of several predefined categories.
    </div>

    <h2>Practice Question 2</h2>
    <p><strong>Which of the following tasks would be best suited for regression analysis?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Determining the probability that a user will click on an advertisement.</li>
        <li>Predicting the number of visitors to a website next month based on historical data.</li>
        <li>Classifying an image as either a cat or a dog.</li>
        <li>Predicting whether a loan applicant will default on their loan.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Predicting the number of visitors to a website next month based on historical data.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a regression problem because the output is a continuous numerical value (i.e., the number of visitors). Regression is used to predict quantities, while classification is used for categorical outcomes.
    </div>

    <h2>Practice Question 3</h2>
    <p><strong>Which of the following statements is true about regression problems?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>They always involve predicting a discrete class label.</li>
        <li>They are used to predict the relationship between variables by fitting a model.</li>
        <li>They involve predicting probabilities of categorical outcomes.</li>
        <li>They are used to group similar items together.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> They are used to predict the relationship between variables by fitting a model.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Regression problems aim to predict numerical values by fitting a model to the data. This model can be used to understand and quantify the relationship between variables, making regression ideal for predicting quantities.
    </div>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Understanding the difference between regression and classification problems is crucial in machine learning. Regression deals with predicting continuous quantities, while classification assigns labels to data points. Make sure to identify the nature of the problem before choosing the appropriate algorithm.</p>
