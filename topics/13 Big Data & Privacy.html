    <h2>Privacy Loss Budget & Differential Privacy</h2>
    <p><strong>Privacy Loss Budget (k):</strong> A parameter used to balance privacy protection with data utility in differential privacy.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High k:</strong> Larger privacy loss, higher utility.</li>
        <li><strong>Low k:</strong> Lower privacy loss, reduced utility.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Global Sensitivity:</strong> The maximum difference in query answers due to the presence or absence of an individual record.</p>
    <p><strong>Differential Privacy:</strong> A method to ensure that the output of a query does not reveal much about any one individual in the dataset.</p>

    <h2>Big Data Analytics & Ethical Considerations</h2>
    <p><strong>Big Data Analytics:</strong> Techniques used to extract meaningful insights from large datasets.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stakeholders:</strong> Individuals, organizations, and society affected by data collection and analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Processes & Implications:</strong> The data processing flow must consider its ethical impact on stakeholders.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>10 Simple Rules for Ethical Big Data Research:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Acknowledge that data are people and can cause harm.</li>
            <li>Recognize that privacy is more than just data security.</li>
            <li>Guard against re-identification by linking datasets.</li>
            <li>Practice ethical data stewardship, even if the data is public.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Examples of Data Sources & Decision-Making Process</h2>
    <p><strong>Examples of Data Sources:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://intelligence.towerdata.com/" target="_blank">TowerData</a> - Data intelligence services.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.iriworldwide.com/en-us/" target="_blank">IRI</a> - Consumer and retail market data.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.intelius.com/" target="_blank">Intelius</a> - People search services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Decision-Making Process:</strong> Big data can be used to support decision-making processes by analyzing data quality, completeness, and its context.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Big Data Quality:</strong> Assessing accuracy and completeness for aggregated data.</li>
        <li><strong>Mosaic Effect:</strong> Combining different data sources can reveal information about individuals even if each source is anonymized.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10 Simple Rules for Responsible Big Data Research</h2>
    <p><strong>Rule 1:</strong> Acknowledge that data are people and can do harm.</p>
    <p><strong>Rule 2:</strong> Recognize that privacy is more than just data security.</p>
    <p><strong>Rule 3:</strong> Understand that data can be re-identified by linking datasets.</p>
    <p><strong>Rule 4:</strong> Be aware of the biases present in datasets.</p>
    <p><strong>Rule 5:</strong> Consider the impact on people when using algorithms to process data.</p>
    <p>For more detailed rules, refer to the source: <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005399" target="_blank">PLOS Computational Biology</a>.</p>

    <h2>When to Break Privacy Rules</h2>
    <p><strong>Exceptions:</strong> In certain situations, it may be necessary to temporarily set aside privacy considerations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Natural Disasters:</strong> To coordinate rescue efforts, sharing location data may be required.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Health Emergencies:</strong> Contact tracing during disease outbreaks may need data sharing.</li>
        <li><strong>Hostile Situations:</strong> Protecting individuals' safety may require breaking privacy rules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, such exceptions should be used sparingly and ethically.</p>

    <h2>Empowering Individuals</h2>
    <p><strong>Empowering Individuals:</strong> It is essential to provide individuals with tools to understand and control their own data.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Raising social awareness about data privacy and its implications.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Access & Control:</strong> Allowing individuals to access and manage their data, e.g., Google activity control settings.</li>
    </ul>
